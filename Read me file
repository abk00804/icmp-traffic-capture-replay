# ICMP Traffic Capture & Replay Lab

## Overview
This repository contains a hands-on lab where ICMP network traffic was captured, analyzed, and replayed using Kali Linux tools. The lab simulates basic SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows, including alert investigation and IDS testing.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- Tshark
- packETH

## What We Did
1. **Network Connectivity Check:** Verified system connectivity using ping.
2. **ICMP Traffic Capture:** Generated ICMP traffic and captured it with Wireshark.
3. **File Format Conversion:** Converted PCAPNG files to PCAP format for compatibility with replay tools.
4. **Packet Replay:** Replayed packets using packETH (single and multiple packet modes).
5. **IDS Rule Creation:** Created a simple IDS rule to detect ICMP traffic.
6. **IDS Traffic Simulation:** Simulated IDS traffic using packETH Mode 5 to understand rule-based detection.

## Conclusion
This lab strengthens foundational knowledge of network security monitoring, packet analysis, and SOC workflows, providing practical exposure to defensive testing and alert validation.
